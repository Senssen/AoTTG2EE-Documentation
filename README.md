# AoTTG2EE-Documentation
### AOTTG2: Expedition Extension introduces a wide range of complex features and mechanics beyond the base game. As a result, it may feel overwhelming or confusing at first.
This public wiki repository is designed to help you explore these features, including any relevant commands where applicable. By using it as a reference, you’ll be able to better understand the systems and incorporate them into your own custom gamemode experiences.

If a feature you don't understand isn't listed here, please let us know in the mod's discord so we can point you in the right direction, or add onto the wiki if we deem it necessary.
